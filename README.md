## Project Overview

React 'n' Slice is designed to offer users a simple yet engaging way to browse a menu of delicious pizzas, customize their orders, and quickly place them—all without requiring a full user account system. The app demonstrates modern React development with state management using Redux, routing with React Router, and utility-first styling via Tailwind CSS.

> **Note:**  
> - The payment process is entirely fictive; no actual payment processing occurs.  
> - The app currently features a simulated login for demonstration purposes, with plans to integrate a full authentication system in the future.  
> - It leverages a real API for data, though it operates within the constraints of a free tier. Please note that the web service hosting the API may go into hibernation if it doesn’t receive inbound traffic for 15 minutes, so allow a few seconds when making HTTP requests (GET, POST, DELETE) to let it wake up.
